After being in the IT industry for over five years now, I still receive messages asking how I got started and managed to study for my A+ certification on my own. So, I thought it would be helpful to organize my journey from the beginning, sharing the materials and strategies that worked for me.

Back in 2019, I decided to pursue the A+ certification, which was a pivotal step in my career transition from Marketing. Before diving in, I tested the waters with the CompTIA ITF+ certification. I wanted to make sure that IT was the right field for me, and it confirmed my interest along with a LOT of research about how I would approach this change. 

One of the most rewarding projects during my preparation was building a computer from scratch. I spent countless hours on Newegg, searching for parts and researching specs to make sure my build would work with the small budget I had at the time. I picked out each component, purchased them, and assembled everything myself. Looking back now, if I could do it again, I’d also consider going to a thrift store and buying a cheap old PC to disassemble and play with. It would have been a cost-effective way to get more hands-on experience with different components and see how everything fits together.

For my study materials, I relied on the "CompTIA A+ Complete Deluxe Study Guide" from Sybex - I got it from Amazon. I read it from start to finish and created and printed a detailed study schedule. I figured out how many pages I needed to read each day and put this schedule on my fridge and bathroom mirror to keep me accountable. Studying independently was new to me, and I initially struggled with consistency, but having that schedule in front of me every day helped me stay disciplined and keep pushing. After a few months, I passed Part I of the A+ exam.

After finishing the book, I supplemented my learning with Professor Messer’s YouTube videos. His explanations reinforced what I’d read and provided clarity on complex topics. I watched the videos when I was bored of reading or while driving, working out, waiting on line for something, etc...

Once I completed both resources, I took a practice exam using Dion Training's content. I highly recommend their practice exams because they are extremely similar to the real thing. This helped me pinpoint my weak areas, so I went back and reviewed those sections in the book.

Passing Part I on my first try was a great feeling, but Part II was more challenging. I didn’t pass it the first time, which was tough, but it taught me about resilience. I regrouped, revisited my weak areas, and reviewed key concepts with both the book and Professor Messer’s videos. With renewed determination, I passed Part II on my second try.

Earning my A+ certification was a significant milestone, opening up new opportunities in my career. Right after passing, I enrolled in an associate degree program in cybersecurity and studied for one semester. I knew I wanted to keep going, and my next goal was to study for the CompTIA Network+ certification. However, the 2020 pandemic changed my plans a bit. But that's a story for another post.
